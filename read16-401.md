# summarizing : 

* Describe the Web-Request-Response-Cycle :

***First a user gives a client a URL, the client builds a request for information (or resources) to be generated by a server. When the server receives that request, it uses the information included in the request to build a response that contains the requested information. Once built, that response is sent back to the client in the requested format, to be rendered to the user*** .

* Explain what a “server” is, as it relates to the WRRC :

**server is a computer that serves information to other computers**.

* What does it mean to “deploy” an application? 

putting it on a Web server so that it can be used either through the Internet or an intranet .

* Terms : 
1. Server :server is a piece of computer hardware or software that provides functionality for other programs or devices, called “clients”. This architecture is called the client–server model. 

2. Pub/Sub : Pub/Sub is an asynchronous messaging service that decouples services that produce events from services that process events.

3. WRRC : The request/response cycle traces how a user’s request flows through the app. Understanding the request/response cycle is helpful to figure out which files to edit when developing an app (and where to look when things aren’t working).

* Virtual Machine :

- What is a virtual machine? :

**A Virtual Machine (VM) is a compute resource that uses software instead of a physical computer to run programs and deploy apps. One or more virtual “guest” machines run on a physical “host” machine. Each virtual machine runs its own operating system and functions separately from the other VMs, even when they are all running on the same host. This means that, for example, a virtual MacOS virtual machine can run on a physical PC**.


***Virtual machine technology is used for many use cases across on-premises and cloud environments. More recently, public cloud services are using virtual machines to provide virtual application resources to multiple users at once, for even more cost efficient and flexible compute***.


- How do virtual machines work? : 

The virtual machine runs as a process in an application window, similar to any other application, on the operating system of the physical machine. Key files that make up a virtual machine include a log file, NVRAM setting file, virtual disk file and configuration file.
