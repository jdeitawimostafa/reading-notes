# summarizing : 

## Functional Programming Concepts : 
* What is functional programming? :
 Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data 

 * there are two types of function : 
 1- pure functions :
 - It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic) . 

 - It does not cause any observable side effects .

 2- impure functions : 
 
- Any function that relies on a random number generator cannot be pure.

* Pure functions benefits : 
1. Given a parameter A → expect the function to return value B .
3. Given a parameter C → expect the function to return value D .

### Refactoring JavaScript for Performance and Readability  : 

* This article about how to write very fast JavaScript. Some of the examples took it to the extreme and became very quick at the cost of being totally unmaintainable. There's a middle ground between speed and comprehension and that's where good code lives.
