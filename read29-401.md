# summarizing : 

* Do child components have direct access to props/state from the parent? 

To be able to access and update state from the child component, we can add a method that handles updating the state to the parent component and pass the method as a prop to the child component instead of the state itself.

* When a component “wraps” another component, how does the child component’s output get rendered? 

Wrapper components are components that surround unknown components and provide a default structure to display the child components. This pattern is useful for creating user interface (UI) elements that are used repeatedly throughout a design, like modals, template pages, and information tiles. 

* Can a component, such as <Content />, which is a child also be used as a standalone component elsewhere in the application? 

Yes, using composition.

* What trick can a parent use to share all props with it’s children ? 

Using Inheretence.

* Terms : 

1. props.children : props. children does is that it is used to display whatever you include between the opening and closing tags when invoking a component. 

2. composition: React composition is a pattern that can be used to break a complex component down to smaller components, and then composing those smaller components to structure and complete your application.

* React Routing : 

**React Routing is a package you need to install to use it. For our purpose of use we gonna use the < BrowserRouter > and < HashRouter > The < BrowserRouter > should be used when you have a server that will handle dynamic requests (knows how to respond to any possible URI), while the < HashRouter > should be used for static websites (where the server can only respond to requests for files that it knows about)**.

**Usually it is preferable to use a < BrowserRouter >, but if your website will be hosted on a server that only serves static files, then the < HashRouter > is a good solution**.

Types of Queries: 

1. Single Elements :

getBy…: Returns the matching node for a query, and throw a descriptive error if no elements match or if more than one match is found (use getAllBy instead if more than one element is expected).

queryBy…: Returns the matching node for a query, and return null if no elements match. This is useful for asserting an element that is not present. Throws an error if more than one match is found (use queryAllBy instead if this is OK).

findBy…: Returns a Promise which resolves when an element is found which matches the given query. The promise is rejected if no element is found or if more than one element is found after a default timeout of 1000ms. If you need to find more than one element, use findAllBy.

2. Multiple Elements: 

getAllBy…: Returns an array of all matching nodes for a query, and throws an error if no elements match.

queryAllBy…: Returns an array of all matching nodes for a query, and return an empty array ([]) if no elements match.

findAllBy…: Returns a promise which resolves to an array of elements when any elements are found which match the given query. The promise is rejected if no elements are found after a default timeout of 1000ms.
