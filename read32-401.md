# summarizing : 

* What does a component’s lifecycle refer to?

**Every React Component has a lifecycle of its own, lifecycle of a component can be defined as the series of methods that are invoked in different stages of the component’s existence. … Mounting: Mounting is the stage of rendering the JSX returned by the render method itself**.

* Why do you sometimes need to “wrap” functions in useCallback when called from within useEffect : 

**useCallback will help in avoiding regeneration of functions when the functional component re-renders. However there isn’t much of a performance difference caused by recreation of functions**.

Using useCallback should be preferred in the following cases

If you are passing the function on to child component as props and the child component doesn’t often need re-rendering except when a certain prop change then useCallback might prevent certain re-renders. However if you state is complex and you need multiple such functions to be passed on to children as props, it better to shift to useReducer instead of useState and pass on the dispatch method to child components

You are specifying a function as a dependency to useEffect. In such as case you must ensure that the function in not recreated on every render or the useEffect will be triggered on every render.

* Terms : 

State hook: A Hook is a special function that lets you “hook into” React features. For example, useState is a Hook that lets you add React state to function components.

Effect hook: The Effect Hook, useEffect , adds the ability to perform side effects from a function component. It serves the same purpose as componentDidMount , componentDidUpdate , and componentWillUnmount in React classes, but unified into a single API.

Reducer hook: The useReducer is a hook I use sometimes to manage the state of the application. … It acts as an alternate hook to the useState hook to manage complex state in your application. The useReducer hook uses the same concept as the reducers in Redux. It is basically a pure function, with no side-effects.

* Custom Hooks React : 
A custom hook allows you to extract some components logic into a reusable function. A custom hook is a Javascript function that starts with use and that call can other hooks. … We are just refactoring our code into another function to make it reusable.

* Using a Custom Hook : 
In the beginning, our stated goal was to remove the duplicated logic from the FriendStatus and FriendListItem components. Both of them want to know whether a friend is online.

* useToggle : 
Basically, what this hook does is that, it takes a parameter with value true or false and toggles that value to opposite. It’s useful when we want to take some action into it’s opposite action.

* useAuth : 
A very common scenario is you have a bunch of components that need to render different depending on whether the current user is logged in and sometimes call authentication methods like signin, signout, sendPasswordResetEmail, etc.

* Rules of Hooks : 
Only Call Hooks at the Top Level. Only Call Hooks from React Functions. Don’t call Hooks from regular JavaScript functions.
