#  summarizing : 

* When is Basic Authorization used ? 
to provide a user name and password when making a request .

* When is bearer Authorization used ?

to get a new Access token. To get an access token you send the Authentication server this bearer token along with your client id .

* What does the JSON Web Token package do ? 

that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.

* What considerations should we make when creating and storing a SECRET? 

1. Never store unencrypted secrets in .git repositories
2. Avoid git add * commands on git
3. Add sensitive files in .gitignore
4. Don’t rely on code reviews to discover secrets
5. Use automated secrets scanning on repositories
6. Don’t share your secrets unencrypted in messaging systems like slack
7. Store secrets safely
8. Use encryption to store secrets within .git repositories
9. Use environment variables
10. Use "Secrets as a service" solutions .

* Terms : 
1. encryption : means of securing digital data using one or more mathematical techniques, along with a password or "key" used to decrypt the information. 
2. token : is a piece of a two-factor authentication security device that may be used to authorize the use of computer services.
3. token : Any party in possession of a bearer token (a “bearer”) can use it to get access to the associated resources (without demonstrating possession of a cryptographic key).
4. secret : is private to you which means you will never reveal that to the public or inject inside the JWT token.
5. JSON Web Token : that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.

## prepration materials : 

* What is RBAC? 

RBAC is nothing more than the idea of assigning system access to users based on their role within an organization. The system needs of a given workforce are analyzed, with users grouped into roles based on common job responsibilities and system access needs. Access is then assigned to each person based strictly on their role assignment. With tight adherence to access requirements established for each role, access management becomes much easier.

* Benefits of RBAC?

With the proper implementation of RBAC, the assignment of access rights becomes systematic and repeatable. Further, it is much easier to audit user rights, and to correct any issues identified.

RBAC may sound intimidating, but it can in reality be easy to implement, and will make the ongoing management of access rights much easier and more secure.

The data breach you prevent may be your own.


* RBAC implementation : 
1. Inventory your systems .
2. Analyze your workforce and create roles
3. Assign people to roles .
4. Never make one-off changes .
5. Audit .
