# summarizing : 

Q1- Explain what a “Singleton” is (in Computer Science terms) :

* singleton pattern is a software design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one "single" instance .

Q2- Explain how the Singleton pattern can be used with Node modules, specifically with classes : 

* the classes should have a private or hidden constructor , getInstance() methods that returns instance of the class . 

* then we have to export the class name , and require it where ever we want to use it , like in test.js for example . 

Q3- If you were tasked with building a middleware system like Express uses, what approach might you take to construct/operate it? : 

*  1. declaring a function takes 3 parameters (req, res , next). 
2. Allow the middleware to have access the layers.
3. we have require it in the desired file .

* Terms : 
1. Router Middleware :  It is a piece of code that comes in the middle of request and response , and router is used to manage these incoming requests.

2. Dynamic Module Loading : is a mechanism by which a computer program can, at run time, load a library (or other binary) into memory, retrieve the addresses of functions and variables contained in the library, execute those functions or access those variables, and unload the library from memory.

3. Singleton Pattern : singleton pattern is a software design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one "single" instance . 

4. CRUD -> REST Method Matches : it's a create , read , update , delete the four operation of presistent storage . 

5. Mock Testing : Mock is a method/object that simulates the behavior of a real method/object in controlled ways. Mock objects are used in unit testing.

## Securing Passwords : 

* Cryptographic hash algorithms MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA512, SHA-3 are general purpose hash functions, designed to calculate a digest of huge amounts of data in as short a time as possible. Hashing is the greatest way for protecting passwords and considered to be pretty safe for ensuring the integrity of data or password. 

* The benefit of hashing is that if someone steals the database with hashed passwords, they only make off with the hashes and not the actual plaintext passwords. But why do we always hear about passwords being cracked? There are some weaknesses in cryptographic hash algorithm that allows an attacker to calculate the original value of a hashed password . 

* PROBLEMS WITH CRYPTOGRAPHIC HASH ALGORITHM : 
1. Brute Force attack . 
2. Hash Collision attack .

### Basic Auth : 

* HTTP Basic authentication (BA) implementation is the simplest technique for enforcing access controls to web resources because it does not require cookies, session identifiers, or login pages; rather, HTTP Basic authentication uses standard fields in the HTTP header. 

* The BA mechanism does not provide confidentiality protection for the transmitted credentials. They are merely encoded with Base64 in transit and not encrypted or hashed in any way. Therefore, basic authentication is typically used in conjunction with HTTPS to provide confidentiality.

Because the BA field has to be sent in the header of each HTTP request, the web browser needs to cache credentials for a reasonable period of time to avoid constantly prompting the user for their username and password. Caching policy differs between browsers.

HTTP does not provide a method for a web server to instruct the client to "log out" the user. However, there are a number of methods to clear cached credentials in certain web browsers. One of them is redirecting the user to a URL on the same domain, using credentials that are intentionally incorrect. However, this behavior is inconsistent between various browsers and browser versions.[1] Microsoft Internet Explorer offers a dedicated JavaScript method to clear cached credentials .

#### OWASP auth cheatsheet : 

* Authentication is the process of verifying that an individual, entity or website is whom it claims to be. Authentication in the context of web applications is commonly performed by submitting a username or ID and one or more items of private information that only a given user should know.

* Session Management is a process by which a server maintains the state of an entity interacting with it. This is required for a server to remember how to react to subsequent requests throughout a transaction. Sessions are maintained on the server by a session identifier which can be passed back and forward between the client and server when transmitting and receiving requests. Sessions should be unique per user and computationally very difficult to predict. The Session Management Cheat Sheet contains further guidance on the best practices in this area.

##### bcrypt docs : 

* Per bcrypt implementation, only the first 72 bytes of a string are used. Any extra bytes are ignored when matching passwords. Note that this is not the first 72 characters. It is possible for a string to contain less than 72 characters, while taking up more than 72 bytes (e.g. a UTF-8 encoded string containing emojis).
