# summarizing : 

* What does it mean that web sockets are bidirectional?Why is this useful?

This enables the server to send real-time updates
asynchronously, without requiring the client to submit a request each time. In the context of networked AV and control
systems, this allows devices to send and receive continuous streams of data to and from any point on the network , so we can save time and effort and our work will more flexible . 

* Does socket.io use HTTP? Why? 

Yes, the socket.io use the http , because it's a protocol and we used the protocol for transforming the data .

* What happens when a client emits an event? 

it will excute everything inside the event . 

* What happens when a server emits an event? 

All listening clients will execute the handler for that event.(sends the data)

* What happens if a client “misses” an event?
for that event will not execute the handler function for it

* How can we mitigate this? 

using messaging queueing

* Terms : 

1. Socket: A socket is one endpoint of a two-way communication link between two programs running on the network. A socket is bound to a port number so that the TCP layer can identify the application that data is destined to be sent to .

2. Web Socket:WebSocket is bidirectional, a full-duplex protocol that is used in the same scenario of client-server communication, unlike HTTP it starts from ws:// or wss://. It is a stateful protocol, which means the connection between client and server will keep alive until it is terminated by either party (client or server). after closing the connection by either of the client and server, the connection is terminated from both the end.

3. Socket.io:Socket.IO enables real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication.

4. Client: hardware or software that accesses a remote service on another computer . 

5. Server:A server is a computer program or device that provides a service to another computer program and its user, also known as the client. In a data center, the physical computer that a server program runs on is also frequently referred to as a server. That machine might be a dedicated server or it might be used for other purposes .

6. OSI Model: Open systems interconnection model is a model that characterizes and standardizes the communication functions of a telecommunication or computing system without regard to its underlying internal structure and technology .

7. TCP Model: Transmission control protocol, essentially a concise version of the OSI model .

8. TCP: Transmission control protocol, one of the main protocols of the internet protocol suite .

9. UDP: User datagram protocol, connectionless protocol so there is no need to establish a connection prior to data transfer .

10. Packets: It is a formatted unit of data carried by a packet-switched network, packet consists of control information and user data/payload .

## prepration materials : 

* Serving HTML
So far in index.js we’re calling res.send and passing it a string of HTML. Our code would look very confusing if we just placed our entire application’s HTML there, so instead we’re going to create a index.html file and serve that instead.

Let’s refactor our route handler to use sendFile instead. 

Integrating Socket.IO
Socket.IO is composed of two parts:

A server that integrates with (or mounts on) the Node.JS HTTP Server socket.io
A client library that loads on the browser side socket.io-client
During development, socket.io serves the client automatically for us, as we’ll see, so for now we only have to install one module:

        npm install socket.io


A room is an arbitrary channel that sockets can join and leave. It can be used to broadcast events to a subset of clients:

Please note that rooms are a server-only concept (i.e. the client does not have access to the list of rooms it has joined).
