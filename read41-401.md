# summarizing : 


* Compare and Contrast Redux Toolkit with Redux “Ducks” : 

- Ducks is a modular pattern that collocates actions, action types and reducers.

- According to the Ducks proposal:

1. MUST export default a function called reducer()

2. MUST export its action creators as functions

3. MUST have action types in the form npm-module-or-app/reducer/ACTION_TYPE

4. MAY export its action types as UPPER_SNAKE_CASE, if an external reducer needs to listen for them, or if it is a published reusable library .


* What is the principle advantage of Redux Toolkit : 

Redux Toolkit makes it easier to write good Redux applications and speeds up development, by baking in our recommended best practices, providing good default behaviors, catching mistakes, and allowing you to write simpler code. Redux Toolkit is beneficial to all Redux users regardless of skill level or experience.

2. namespace:

With Redux, you can use combineReducers to create nested reducers that only operate on a slice of state, but all reducers still respond to all actions. Often this is the point—a component can affect another component just by dispatching an action. But when we started creating multiple instances of the same component, we created a system where every instance responded to action meant for just one.

## preparation materials : 

* getting started with react native open source framework for building Android and iOS applications using React “Views” are the building blocks of iphone and android apps React native allows for developing “native apps” that would otherwise be written in Kotlin or Java for Android and Swift or Obective-C for iOS Core components, essential ready to use native components already built and available .

- React Native Advantages: Optimal Performance Code Reusability Large Community Cost Effective Modular Architecture Hot Reloading Support Simple User Interface Offers More Stable Apps Third-Party Plugins Support Handy Solutions & Libraries

Ejecting to ExpoKit  : 

- What is this for?

**If you created an Expo project and you want a way to add custom native modules, this guide will explain how to use ExpoKit for that purpose. Normally, Expo apps are written in pure JS and never “drop down” to the native iOS or Android layer. This is core to the Expo philosophy and it’s part of what makes Expo fast and powerful to use. However, there are some cases where advanced developers need native capabilities outside of what Expo offers out-of-the-box. The most common situation is when a project requires a specific Native Module which is not supported by React Native Core or the Expo SDK. In this case, Expo allows you to eject your pure-JS project from the Expo iOS/Android clients, providing you with native projects that can be opened and built with Xcode and Android Studio. Those projects will have dependencies on ExpoKit, so everything you already built will keep working as it did before. We call this “ejecting” because you still depend on the Expo SDK, but your project no longer lives inside Expo Go. You control the native projects, including configuring and building them yourself.**
