## Article Responsive Web Design : 

* Responsive web design is focused around providing an intuitive and gratifying experience for everyone. Desktop computer and cell phone users alike all benefit from responsive websites.

* Responsive web design is broken down into three main components : 
1. flexible layouts : is the practice of building the layout of a website with a flexible grid, capable of dynamically resizing to any width .

3. media queries : Media queries were built as an extension to media types commonly found when targeting and including styles. Media queries provide the ability to specify different styles for individual browser and device circumstances, the width of the viewport or device orientation for example . 

* flexible grid : Using the flexible grid formula we can take all of the fixed units of length and turn them into relative units .

* Logical Operators in Media Queries
Logical operators in media queries help build powerful expressions. There are three different logical operators available for use within media queries, including and, not, and only.

* Height & Width Media Features
One of the most common media features revolves around determining a height or width for a device or browser viewport. The height and width may be found by using the height and width media features. Each of these media features may then also be prefixed with the min or max qualifiers, building a feature such as min-width or max-width.

* Viewport Height & Width
Using the viewport meta tag with either the height or width values will define the height or width of the viewport respectively. Each value accepts either a positive integer or keyword. For the height property the keyword device-height value is accepted, and for the width property the keyword device-width is accepted. Using these keywords will inherit the device’s default height and width value.

* Viewport Resolution
Letting the browser decide how to scale a website based off any viewport scale values usually does the trick. When more control is needed, specifically over the resolution of a device, the target-densitydpi value may be used. The target-densitydpi viewport accepts a handful of values including device-dpi, high-dpi, medium-dpi, low-dpi, or an actual DPI number.

5. flexible media : To take a look at some of the ways you can handle flexible media we will break them down into their individual elements :

- Images .
- Iframes .
- Flexible Video .

### Article all about floats: 
* What is Float? 
Float is a CSS positioning property,In a print layout, images may be set into the page such that text wraps around them as needed. This is commonly and appropriately called “text wrap”.

* What are floats used for? 
floats can be used to create entire web layouts , Floats are also helpful for layout in smaller instances.

* Clearing the Float : Float’s sister property is clear. An element that has the clear property set on it will not move up adjacent to the float like the float desires, but will move itself down past the float. Again an illustration probably does more good than words do , Clear has four valid values as well. Both is most commonly used, which clears floats coming from either direction. Left and Right can be used to only clear the float from one direction respectively. None is the default, which is typically unnecessary unless removing a clear value from a cascade. Inherit would be the fifth, but is strangely not supported in Internet Explorer. Clearing only the left or right float, while less commonly seen in the wild, definitely has its uses.

* Problems with Floats
Floats often get beat on for being fragile. The majority of this fragility comes from IE 6 and the slew of float-related bugs it has. As more and more designers are dropping support for IE 6, you may not care, but for the folks that do care here is a quick rundown.
