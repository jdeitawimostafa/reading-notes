* simple set of steps for any algorithm type programming problem : 
1. Read the problem completely twice : 
* If you don’t understand the problem, you cannot solve it.  Do not worry about wasting time here, because the better you understand the problem, the easier it will be to solve it.


2. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data :
* It’s very important that when you solve a problem manually, you recognize what your brain is actually doing to solve the problem.  You may need to write out all the things you are normally storing in your head.  You want to be aware of each step, it is easy to gloss over them.


3. Optimize the manual steps : 
* What you want to do here is figure out if there is another way you can solve the problem easier, or if there are some steps you can cut our or simplify.


4. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code : 
* If you are a beginner or struggle with these kinds of problems, I would go ahead and take the time to do this step anyway though. 


5. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code .
6. Optimize the real code.

* Many times you will find that a problem itself involves multiple large steps or is very complicated.  In those instances, you will want to try and find a way to cut the problem directly in half and then following the process above for each half. 

### Pretend Your Time is Worth $1,000/Hour and You’ll Become : 

 * If you let it, your world and the people around you will take all your time. Your time is not unlike your paycheck; if you don’t budget for things, you’ll have nothing left over by the end of the month.

* “Living in frenzy is a sign we’ve squandered too much.” -Niklas Goke .

* In reality, a lot of people are living a frenzied, busy life. They wear their business as a badge of honor, and brag about their full schedules.
Frankly, most people prefer the little dopamine boost of checking boxes on a to-do list than actually getting important work done.

#### How to think like a programmer : 

* what should you do when you encounter a new problem? Here are the steps: 
1. Understand .
2. Plan .
3. Divide . 
4. Practice : 

* Don’t expect to be great after just one week. If you want to be a good problem-solver, solve a lot of problems!

* Practice. Practice. Practice. It’ll only be a matter of time before you recognize that “this problem could easily be solved with 'insert concept here'.”

* Debug: Go step by step through your solution trying to find where you went wrong. Programmers call this debugging (in fact, this is all a debugger does).

* “The art of debugging is figuring out what you really told your program to do rather than what you thought you told it to do.”” — Andrew Singer

* Reassess: Take a step back. Look at the problem from another perspective. Is there anything that can be abstracted to a more general approach?


* “Sometimes we get so lost in the details of a problem that we overlook general principles that would solve the problem at a more general level.

* The classic example of this, of course, is the summation of a long list of consecutive integers, 1 + 2 + 3 + … + n, which a very young Gauss quickly recognized was simply n(n+1)/2, thus avoiding the effort of having to do the addition.” — C. Jordan Ball

##### 5 Whys : 

* When to Use a 5 Whys Analysis :
* You can use 5 Whys for troubleshooting, quality improvement, and problem solving, but it is most effective when used to resolve simple or moderately difficult problems.

* How to Use the 5 Whys : 
1. Assemble a Team .
2. Define the Problem .
3. Ask the First "Why?" .
