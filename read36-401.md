# summarizing : 

1. What are the advantages of storing tokens in “Cookies” vs “Local Storage”

Local storage is vulnerable because it’s easily accessible using JavaScript and an attacker can retrieve your access token and use it later.
The cookie is not accessible via JavaScript; hence, it is not as vulnerable to XSS attacks as localStorage.

2. Explain 3rd party cookies. Third-party cookies are cookies that are set by a website other than the one you are currently on. For example, you can have a “Like” button on your website which will store a cookie on visitor’s computer, that cookie can later be accessed by Facebook to identify visitor and see which websites he visited. Such cookie is considered to be a third-party cookie.

3. How do pixel tags work? For marketing or media without a click event (such as navigating directly to a marketer’s website), click redirects cannot be used. In those cases, pixel tags (also known as pixels, 1x1 pixels, image tags or web bugs) are used instead. Pixel tags are typically single pixel, transparent GIF images that are added to a web page. Even though the pixel tag is virtually invisible, it is still served just like any other image you may see online. The trick is that the web page is served from the website’s domain while the image is served from the ad server’s domain. This allows the ad server to read and record the cookie with the unique ID and the extended information it needs to record.


* Terms : 

1. cookies They are pieces of code that web servers use to put information on a user’s browser, and then retrieve that information at a later time for various uses.

2. authorization access rights/privileges to resources

3. access control selective restriction of access to a place or other resource while access management describes the process. The act of accessing may mean consuming, entering, or using. Permission to access a resource is called authorization.

4. conditional rendering Conditional rendering in React works the same way conditions work in JavaScript. Use JavaScript operators like if or the conditional operator to create elements representing the current state, and let React update the UI to match them

## preparation materials : 


* What is Redux ?
Redux is a pattern and library for managing and updating application state, using events called “actions”.

- It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience

* Why Should I Use Redux?

Redux helps you manage “global” state - state that is needed across many parts of your application.

* When Should I Use Redux?
Redux helps you deal with shared state management, but like any tool, it has tradeoffs. There are more concepts to learn, and more code to write. It also adds some indirection to your code, and asks you to follow certain restrictions. It’s a trade-off between short term and long term productivity.

* Benefits of redux:

- You have large amounts of application state that are needed in many places in the app

- The app state is updated frequently over time

- The logic to update that state may be complex

- The app has a medium or large-sized codebase, and might be worked on by many people

* Redux state : 

- It is a self-contained app with the following parts:

- The state, the source of truth that drives our app

- The view, a declarative description of the UI based on the current state

- The actions, the events that occur in the app based on user input, and trigger updates in the state .
