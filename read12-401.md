# summarizing : 

* What is the benefit of transforming data into packets?

Allows for data to be transferred fast and efficiently over the network and minimizes the transmission latency.

*  UDP is often refereed to as a connectionless protocol. Why is this?

UDP is a connectionless protocol. It is known as a datagram protocol because it is analogous to sending a letter where you don’t acknowledge receipt. Examples of applications that use connectionless transport services are broadcasting and tftp .

* Can a socket server application have multiple socket connections?

A server socket listens on a single port, but it is able to share the same server-side IP/Port pair as long as they are associated with different client-side IP/Port pairs

* Can a socket connection application be connected to multiple socket servers?

Yes, it can handle up to 65535.

* Can an application be both a socket server and a socket connection?

Yes

* Terms : 
1. Observer Pattern : The observer pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, named the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.

2. Listener : a function that listens for an event to occur . 

3. Event Handler : can be used to handle and verify user input, user actions, and browser actions: Things that should be done every time a page loads. 

4.  Driven Programming : programming paradigm in which the flow of the program is determined by events such as user actions, message passing

5. Event Loop : The event loop continuously checks the call stack to see if there’s any function that needs to run. While doing so, it adds any function call it finds to the call stack and executes each one in order.

6. Event Queue : is responsible for sending new functions to the track for processing.

7. Call Stack : A call stack is a mechanism for an interpreter (like the JavaScript interpreter in a web browser) to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions — what function is currently being run and what functions are called from within that function .

## perpration materials : 

* WebSocket : 
- WebSocket is a computer communications protocol, providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection . 

- WebSocket is distinct from HTTP. Both protocols are located at layer 7 in the OSI model and depend on TCP at layer 4. Although they are different, RFC 6455 states . 

- The WebSocket protocol enables interaction between a web browser (or other client application) and a web server with lower overhead than half-duplex alternatives such as HTTP polling, facilitating real-time data transfer from and to the server.

- The communications are usually done over TCP port number 443 (or 80 in the case of unsecured connections), which is beneficial for environments that block non-web Internet connections using a firewall.

* Socket.io :

1. It is the library to work with WebSocket
2. Provides the event-based communication between browser and server.
3. A connection can be established in the presence of proxies and load balancers.
4. It supports broadcasting.
5. It supports fallback options.
