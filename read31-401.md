# summarizing : 

1. Why do we not need more .html pages in a multi-page React app? 

React takes advantage of HTML’s popularity and strength as the most popular programming language, by letting you use a very similar syntax to HTML to build interfaces and add dynamic features to it using JavaScript.

2. If we wanted a component to show up on every page, where would we put it and why?
Outside the `<BrowserRouter/>`

Inside the `<BrowserRouter />`, outside a `<Route />`
Inside a `<Route />` We put it inside the `<Route>`

3. What does props.children contain?

All the elements, values of the component, it’s useful if we need to render multiple components dynamically depending on the data needed to be rendered.

* Terms : 

1. Composition React Composition is a development pattern based on React’s original component model where we build components from other components using explicit defined props or the implicit children prop. 

2. Children / Child Components children is a special property of React components which contains any child elements defined within the component .

3. Hash Routing It uses URL hash, it puts no limitations on supported browsers or web server.

4. Link Routing A string representing the path to link to

## preparation materials : 

**Hooks: Hooks are the new feature introduced in the React 16.8 version. It allows you to use state and other React features without writing a class. Hooks are the functions which “hook into” React state and lifecycle features from function components. It does not work inside classes.**

* Hooks are backward-compatible, which means it does not contain any breaking changes. Also, it does not replace your knowledge of React concepts.

**If you write a function component, and then you want to add some state to it, previously you do this by converting it to a class. But, now you can do it by using a Hook inside the existing function component.**

* Rules of Hooks:

1. Only call Hooks at the top level. Only call Hooks from React functions. Pre-requisites for React Hooks

2. Node version 6 or above NPM version 5.2 or above We need hooks when we can’t break a complex UI to the first level.

3. Hooks apply the React philosophy (explicit data flow and composition) inside a component, rather than just between the components.

4. useState is a Hook (we’ll talk about what this means in a moment)

5. The only argument to useState is the initial state.The initial state argument is only used during the first render.

6. useState return a pair of values: the current state and a function that updates it.

**useEffect do tell React that your component needs to do something after render. React will remember the function you passed (we’ll refer to it as our “effect”), and call it later after performing the DOM updates. In this effect, we set the document title, but we could also perform data fetching or call some other imperative API.**

* We use useEffect after every render.
