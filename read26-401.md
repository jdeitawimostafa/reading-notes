# summarizing : 

* Name 5 Javascript UI Frameworks (other than React) : 
1. Angular .
2. Vue.js .
3. jQuery .
4. Node.js .
5. Ember.js .

* What’s the difference between a framework and a library? 

**The key difference between a library and a framework is "Inversion of Control",When you call a method from a library, you are in control. But with a framework, the control is inverted: the framework calls you.** .

* Terms : 

1. Rendering : **set of lines that will show up once the function invoked** . 

2. Templates : ***is a chunk of HTML that you need to inject onto the page***.

3. State : state in react is the data that will the object has as a properties.

* The smallest React example looks like this : 

            ReactDOM.render(
             <h1>Hello, world!</h1>,
             document.getElementById('root')
);

**It displays a heading saying “Hello, world!” on the page** .

* what is jsx ? 

**JSX stands for JavaScript XML. JSX allows us to write HTML in React. JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML in React**.

* Why JSX?
**React embraces the fact that rendering logic is inherently coupled with other UI logic: how events are handled, how the state changes over time, and how the data is prepared for display**.

***Instead of artificially separating technologies by putting markup and logic in separate files, React separates concerns with loosely coupled units called “components” that contain both. We will come back to components in a further section, but if you’re not yet comfortable putting markup in JS, this talk might convince you otherwise***.

**React doesn’t require using JSX, but most people find it helpful as a visual aid when working with UI inside the JavaScript code. It also allows React to show more useful error and warning messages**.


* Rendering an Element into the DOM
Let’s say there is a -div- somewhere in your HTML file:

            <div id="root"></div>

* We call this a “root” DOM node because everything inside it will be managed by React DOM.

**Applications built with just React usually have a single root DOM node. If you are integrating React into an existing app, you may have as many isolated root DOM nodes as you like**.

To render a React element into a root DOM node, pass both to ReactDOM.render():

            const element = <h1>Hello, world</h1>;
            ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root'));


**It displays “Hello, world” on the page**.
