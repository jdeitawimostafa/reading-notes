# summarizing :

* SuperAgent is light-weight progressive ajax API crafted for flexibility, readability, and a low learning curve after being frustrated with many of the existing request APIs. It also works with Node.js! 

* A request can be initiated by invoking the appropriate method on the request object, then calling .then() (or .end() or await) to send the request.



* DELETE, HEAD, PATCH, POST, and PUT requests can also be used, simply change the method name:

request
  .head('/favicon.ico')
  .then(res => {

  });




* DELETE can be also called as .del() for compatibility with old IE where delete is a reserved word.

The HTTP method defaults to GET, so if you wish, the following is valid:

 request('/search', (err, res) => {

 });




* GET requests :

The .query() method accepts objects, which when used with the GET method will form a query-string. The following will produce the path /search?query=Manny&range=1..5&order=desc.

 request
   .get('/search')
   .query({ query: 'Manny' })
   .query({ range: '1..5' })
   .query({ order: 'desc' })
   .then(res => {

   });

Or as a single object:

request
  .get('/search')
  .query({ query: 'Manny', range: '1..5', order: 'desc' })
  .then(res => {

  });

* After extensive research in studying the work of the teams like Project Aristotle What interested the researchers most, however, was that teams that did well on one assignment usually did well on all the others. Conversely, teams that failed at one thing seemed to fail at everything and they noticed two behaviors that all the good teams generally shared. First, on the good teams, members spoke in roughly the same proportion, a phenomenon the researchers referred to as ‘‘equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking.’’ and the good teams all had high ‘‘average social sensitivity’’ — a fancy way of saying they were skilled at intuiting how others felt based on their tone of voice, their expressions, and other nonverbal cues .
