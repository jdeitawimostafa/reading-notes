# summarizing : 

* How granular should your reducers be? : 

- In order to tell whether actions A and B are really one or two actions, you need to ask yourself: “If I change how some reducers react to A, will I also need to change how they react to B?”

**When the handlers change together in the reducer code, it’s likely they should be a single action. When their changes may not affect each other, or if many reducers handle just one of them but not the other, they should probably stay separate**.

- Pro or Con – multiple reducers can “fire” when a commonly named action is dispatched . 

Dispatching an action within a reducer is an anti-pattern. Your reducer should be without side effects, simply digesting the action payload and returning a new state object. Adding listeners and dispatching actions within the reducer can lead to chained actions and other side effects.

* Name a strategy for preventing the above :

- There are two very popular middleware libraries that allow for side effects and asynchronous actions: Redux Thunk and Redux Saga. In this post, you will explore Redux Thunk.

* Terms : 

1. Store: A store is an immutable object tree in Redux. A store is a state container which holds the application’s state. Redux can have only a single store in your application. Whenever a store is created in Redux, you need to specify the reducer.

2. Combined reducers: The most common state shape for a Redux app is a plain Javascript object containing “slices” of domain-specific data at each top-level key. … First and foremost, combineReducers is simply a utility function to simplify the most common use case when writing Redux reducers.

* Async Logic and Data Fetching : 

- Redux Middleware and Side Effects 
1
Earlier, we said that Redux reducers must never contain “side effects”. A “side effect” is any change to state or behavior that can be seen outside of returning a value from a function. Some common kinds of side effects are things like:

1. Logging a value to the console
2. Saving a file
3. Setting an async timer
4. Making an AJAX HTTP request
5. Modifying some state that exists outside of a function, or mutating arguments to a function
6. Generating random numbers or unique random IDs (such as Math.random() or Date.now())


* Writing an Async Function Middleware :

Both of the middleware in that last section were very specific and only do one thing. It would be nice if we had a way to write any async logic ahead of time, separate from the middleware itself, and still have access to dispatch and getState so that we can interact with the store.

What if we wrote a middleware that let us pass a function to dispatch, instead of an action object? We could have our middleware check to see if the “action” is actually a function instead, and if it’s a function, call the function right away. That would let us write async logic in separate functions, outside of the middleware definition.


- Using the Redux Thunk Middleware : 

***As it turns out, Redux already has an official version of that “async function middleware”, called the Redux “Thunk” middleware. The thunk middleware allows us to write functions that get dispatch and getState as arguments. The thunk functions can have any async logic we want inside, and that logic can dispatch actions and read the store state as needed.***
