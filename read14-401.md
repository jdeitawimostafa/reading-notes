# summarizing : 

* What’s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue? 

FIFO queues have essentially the same features as standard queues, but provide the added benefits of supporting ordering and exactly-once processing. FIFO queues provide additional features that help prevent unintentional duplicates from being sent by message producers or from being received by message consumers .

* How can the server be assured a message was properly received? 

by getting a feedback message from the main server that the message received .

* What classic design pattern is best represented by event driven programming? 

Event Notification

* How do you test an event driven system? 

emit an event and check if It’s run the code in the event listener.

* Terms : 

1. FIFO Queue : FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queues are designed to enhance messaging between applications when the order of operations and events is critical, or where duplicates can’t be tolerated .

2. Pub/Sub : (Publish–subscribe pattern) Publish–subscribe is a sibling of the message queue paradigm, and is typically one part of a larger message-oriented middleware system. Most messaging systems support both the pub/sub and message queue models in their API .

*** 
### prepration materials : 


* SNS: (Simple Notification Service) is a distributed publish-subscribe system. Messages are pushed to subscribers as and when they are sent by publishers to SNS.

SQS: (Simple Queue Service) is distributed queuing system. Polling inherently introduces some latency in message delivery in SQS unlike SNS where messages are immediately pushed to subscribers.
