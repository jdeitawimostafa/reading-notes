# summarizing : 

## chapter 3 (lists) : 
- *There are lots of occasions when we
need to use lists. HTML provides us with
three different types* :
1. orderd lists : are lists where each item in the list is
numbered . 
2. unorderd lists : are lists that begin with a bullet point .
3. definition lists : are made up of a set of terms along with the
definitions for each of those terms. 

4. nested lists : if we weant to add sub lists into a list .

* if we want to create and order list we have to create an opening tag then ol isnide the opening tag,
and ul if we want to create unorder list also inside the opening tag , then li also in opening tag then type the name of your list .

* the definition lists : 
we have to create an opening tag then d1 inside the opening tag , Inside the dl element you will
usually see pairs of dt and
dd elements , dt : This is used to contain the term being defined , dd : This is used to contain the
definition .

### chapter 13 ( boxes) : 

* By default a box is sized just big
enough to hold its contents. To
set your own dimensions for a
box you can use the height and
width properties.

* we can limiting the width by using : 
1. min-width :to make sure that they do not appear too narrow . 
2. max-width : to ensure that lines of text do not appear too wide within a big
browser window .  


* also we can limiting the height by using : 
1. min height . 
2. max-height . 

* overflow content : we use it if the content contained within a box is larger than the box itself. It can have one of two values : 
1. hidden :  This property simply hides any extra content that does not fit in
the box.
2. scroll : This property adds a scrollbar to the box so that users can scroll
to see the missing content. 

* Every box has three available properties that can be adjusted to control its appearance:
1. border : The border property allows you to specify the width, style and
color of a border in one property . 
2. margin : the margin property controls the gap between boxes. Its value
is commonly given in pixels, although you may also use percentages or ems.
3. padding : The padding property allows you to specify how much space should appear between the content of an element and its border.

property. This property can take the following values:
1. solid . 
2. dotted 
3. dashed . 
4. double . 
5. groove . 

* border color : we can specify the color of a border using either RGB values,
hex codes or CSS color names .

#### chapter 4 (decision and loops) : 
- Like other languages, JavaScript also provides many decision making statements like if, else, etc . : 

1. if statement : if is used to check for a condition whether its true or not. Condition could be any expression that returns true or false. When condition satisfies then statements following if statement are executed.

2. else statement : else statements are used with if statements. When if condition gets fail then else statement is executed. 

*there are two components to a decision* : 
1. an expression is evaluated , which returns a value .
2. a conditional statement says what to do in a given situation . 

* there are three common type of loops : 
1. for . 
2. while . 
3. Do while . 

* loop counters : 
1. initalization . 
2. conditon . 
3. update . 

* there are a common keywords used in loops : 
1. break . 
2. continue .
