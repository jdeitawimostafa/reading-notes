## chapter 3 (lists) : 
- *There are lots of occasions when we
need to use lists. HTML provides us with
three different types* :
1. orderd lists : are lists where each item in the list is
numbered . 
2. unorderd lists : are lists that begin with a bullet point .
3. definition lists : are made up of a set of terms along with the
definitions for each of those terms. 

4. nested lists : if we weant to add sub lists into a list .

* if we want to create and order list we have to create an opening tag then ol isnide the opening tag,
and ul if we want to create unorder list also inside the opening tag , then li also in opening tag then type the name of your list .

* the definition lists : 
we have to create an opening tag then d1 inside the opening tag , Inside the dl element you will
usually see pairs of dt and
dd elements , dt : This is used to contain the term being defined , dd : This is used to contain the
definition .
