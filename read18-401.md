# summarizing :

* What are serverless functions? 

**erverless functions are single-purpose, programmatic functions that are hosted on managed infrastructure. These functions, which are invoked through the Internet, are hosted and maintained by cloud computing companies.**.

* If you were to create a system that emulated Lambda functions, how would you do it? 

1. To create a Lambda function with the console
2. Open the Functions page on the Lambda console.
3. Choose Create function.
4. Under Basic information, do the following:
5. For Function name, enter my-function.
6. For Runtime, confirm that Node.js 14.x is selected. Note that Lambdaprovides runtimes for .NET (PowerShell,C#) Go, Java, Node.js, Python, and Ruby.
8. Choose Create function.
9. Lambda creates a Node.js function and an execution role that grants the function permission to upload logs. The Lambda function assumes the execution role when you invoke your function, and uses the execution role to create credentials for the AWS SDK and to read data from event sources.

* Describe how a CDN works : 

***CDNs store a cached version of your website content in multiple geographical locations around the world, which are known as “points of presence” (PoPs). These PoPs will contain their own caching servers and will be responsible for delivering that content in the user’s location***.

## Terms :

1. serverless functions :serverless functions are single-purpose, programmatic functions that are hosted on managed infrastructure. These functions, which are invoked through the Internet, are hosted and maintained by cloud computing companies.

2. Cloud Storage : is a cloud computing model that stores data on the Internet through a cloud computing provider who manages and operates data storage .

3. CDN : A content delivery network (CDN) refers to a geographically distributed group of servers which work together to provide fast delivery of Internet content.

* AWS API Gateway : 

Amazon API Gateway is a managed service that allows developers to define the HTTP endpoints of a REST API or a WebSocket API and connect those endpoints with the corresponding backend business logic. It also handles authentication, access control, monitoring, and tracing of API requests.

* How does API Gateway work? : 

**API Gateway sits between the backend services of your API and your API’s users, handling the HTTP requests to your API endpoints and routing them to the correct backends. It provides a set of tools that help you manage your API definitions and the mappings between endpoints and their respective backend services. It can also generate API references from your definitions and make them available to your users as API documentation**.

***API Gateway integrates with many other AWS services like AWS Lambda, AWS SNS, AWS IAM, and Cognito Identity Pools. These integrations allow for fully managed authentication and authorization layers, as well as detailed metrics and tracing for API requests***.

* How does API Gateway integrate with other AWS services? : 

Many AWS services support integration with Amazon API Gateway, including:

1. AWS Lambda: run Lambda functions to generate HTTP API responses.
2. AWS SNS: publish SNS notifications when an HTTP API endpoint is accessed.
3. Amazon Cognito: provide authentication and authorization for your HTTP APIs.

* Amazon API Gateway : 

**Amazon API Gateway is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale. APIs act as the "front door" for applications to access data, business logic, or functionality from your backend services. Using API Gateway, you can create RESTful APIs and WebSocket APIs that enable real-time two-way communication applications. API Gateway supports containerized and serverless workloads, as well as web applications**.

* What is DynamoDB?

DynamoDB is a hosted NoSQL database offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It offers:

1. reliable performance even as it scales;
2. a managed experience, so you won't be SSH-ing into servers to upgrade the crypto libraries;
3. a small, simple API allowing for simple key-value access as well as more advanced query patterns.

* What is Amazon DynamoDB?
Amazon DynamoDB is a key-value and document database that delivers single-digit millisecond performance at any scale. It's a fully managed, multi-region, multi-active, durable database with built-in security, backup and restore, and in-memory caching for internet-scale applications. DynamoDB can handle more than 10 trillion requests per day and can support peaks of more than 20 million requests per second.
