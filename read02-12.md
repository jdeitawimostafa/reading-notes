# summarizing : 
## charts : 
* Charts are far better for displaying data visually than tables and have the added benefit that no one is ever going to press-gang them into use as a layout tool. They’re easier to look at and convey data quickly, but they’re not always easy to create.

* there are a three common type of charts : 
1. line chart .
2. pie chart .
3. bar chart .

* there are a steps to start with chart : 
1. Setting up : The first thing we need to do is download Chart.js. Copy the Chart.min.js out of the unzipped folder and into the directory you’ll be working in. Then create a new html page and import the script .

* we can draw every type of chart : 
1. Drawing a line chart : To draw a line chart, the first thing we need to do is create a canvas element in our HTML in which Chart.js can draw our chart. So add this to the body of our HTML page , Next, we need to write a script that will retrieve the context of the canvas, so add this to the foot of your body element ,nside the same script tags we need to create our data, in this instance it’s an object that contains labels for the base of our chart and datasets to describe the values on the chart. Add this immediately above the line that begins ‘var buyers=’: 

2. Drawing a pie chart : we need the canvas element , Next, we need to get the context and to instantiate the chart, 
You’ll notice that this time, we are going to supply some options to the chart. Next we need to create the data. This data is a little different to the line chart because the pie chart is simpler, we just need to supply a value and a color for each section .

### canvas element : 
* At first sight a canvas looks like the img element, with the only clear difference being that it doesn't have the src and alt attributes. Indeed, the canvas element has only two attributes, width and height. These are both optional and can also be set using DOM properties.

* The canvas element differs from an img tag in that, like for video, audio, or picture elements, it is easy to define some fallback content, to be displayed in older browsers not supporting it, like versions of Internet Explorer earlier than version 9 or textual browsers. You should always provide fallback content to be displayed by those browsers.

* The canvas element creates a fixed-size drawing surface that exposes one or more rendering contexts, which are used to create and manipulate the content shown. In this tutorial, we focus on the 2D rendering context. Other contexts may provide different types of rendering; for example, WebGL uses a 3D context based on OpenGL ES.

#### drawing shapes with canvas :

* The grid : Before we can start drawing, we need to talk about the canvas grid or coordinate space. Our HTML skeleton from the previous page had a canvas element 150 pixels wide and 150 pixels high. To the right, you see this canvas with the default grid overlayed. Normally 1 unit in the grid corresponds to 1 pixel on the canvas. The origin of this grid is positioned in the top left corner at coordinate (0,0). All elements are placed relative to this origin. So the position of the top left corner of the blue square becomes x pixels from the left and y pixels from the top, at coordinate (x,y). Later in this tutorial we'll see how we can translate the origin to a different position, rotate the grid and even scale it, but for now we'll stick to the default.

* Drawing rectangles : Unlike SVG, canvas element only supports two primitive shapes: rectangles and paths (lists of points connected by lines). All other shapes must be created by combining one or more paths. Luckily, we have an assortment of path drawing functions which make it possible to compose very complex shapes.

First let's look at the rectangle. There are three functions that draw rectangles on the canvas:

fillRect(x, y, width, height)
Draws a filled rectangle.
strokeRect(x, y, width, height)
Draws a rectangular outline.
clearRect(x, y, width, height)

##### applying style and color : 
* Colors
Up until now we have only seen methods of the drawing context. If we want to apply colors to a shape, there are two important properties we can use: fillStyle and strokeStyle.

fillStyle = color
Sets the style used when filling shapes.
strokeStyle = color
Sets the style for shapes' outlines.
color is a string representing a CSS color, a gradient object, or a pattern object. We'll look at gradient and pattern objects later. By default, the stroke and fill color are set to black (CSS color value #000000).

there are a lot of styles like : 
1. strokstyle . 
2. fillstyle . 
3. transperncy .
4. a global alpha .
