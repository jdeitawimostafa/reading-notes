# summarizing : 

1. Can a parent component access the state of a child component? 
yes . 

2. What can be passed along in a prop variable? 
we can pass any properties we want to use in another component . 

3. How can a child component “know” the state of another component?

by using props object , but we can't change anything inside props , we have to use the own state of every component to change and modify something . 

* Terms : 

1. component props : Props are arguments passed into React components. Props are passed to components via HTML attributes. 

2. component state : the State of a component is an object that holds some information that may change over the lifetime of the component . 

3. application state :  State helps in keeping the data of different components in sync since each state update will re-render all relevant components .

1. Mounting : 

Since class-based components are classes, hence the name, the first method that runs is the constructor method. Typically, the constructor is where you would initialize component state.

Now we come to the render method which returns your JSX. Now React “mounts” onto the DOM.

Lastly, the componentDidMount method runs. Here is where you would do any asynchronous calls to databases or directly manipulate the DOM if you need. Just like that, our component is born. 

2. Updating : 

This phase is triggered every time state or props change. Like in mounting, getDerivedStateFromProps is called (but no constructor this time!).

Next shouldComponentUpdate runs. Here you can compare old props/state with the new set of props/state. You can determine if your component should re-render or not by returning true or false. This can make your web app more efficient by cutting down on extra re-renders. If shouldComponentUpdate returns false, this update cycle ends.

If not, React re-renders and getSnapshotBeforeUpdate runs afterwards. This method has limited use as well. React then runs componentDidUpdate. Like componentDidMount you can use it to make any async calls or manipulate the DOM.

3. Unmounting : 
Our component lived a good life, but all good things must come to an end. The unmounting phase is that last stage of the component lifecycle. When you remove a component from the DOM, React runs component Will Unmount right before it gets removed. You should use this method to clean up any open connections such as WebSockets or intervals.

* What even is ‘children’?

The React docs say that you can use props.children on components that represent ‘generic boxes’ and that ‘don’t know their children ahead of time’.

            function FancyBorder(props) {
            return (
             <div className={'FancyBorder FancyBorder-' + props.color}>
             {props.children}
            </div>
                );
            }


                   function WelcomeDialog() {
                      return (
                <FancyBorder color="blue">
                 <h1 className="Dialog-title">
                      Welcome
                </h1>
                 <p className="Dialog-message">
                   Thank you for visiting our spacecraft!
                 </p>
                </FancyBorder>
            );
            }
