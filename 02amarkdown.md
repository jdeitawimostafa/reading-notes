*Today we learned how to use github , it's a version control system to edit and installed more features and fix some issues that we faced in our codes . then we learned how to add files and folders inside git , one by one or we can add some of folders and files together . we can use : git add file name ( to add folders and files one by one) and we can use : git add . ( to add more than files or folders in one time) then we learned how to apply the files that i have added , we can use : git commit -m " message " and how to move the files from local machine to cloud , we can use : git push origin push* 

***mark down is a way to style text on the web and you control the display of the document . we can bold the texts , headrs , italic such as : # this is like h1 tag in html language , to enter links use : [name of the website] (the url of the website) and there is more features , order and unorder list , qouted text*** .
