# summarizing : 

* Why is the Context API useful? : 

 **The React Context API is a way for a React app to effectively produce global variables that can be passed around. This is the alternative to “prop drilling” or moving props from grandparent to child to parent, and so on. Context is also touted as an easier, lighter approach to state management using Redux.**

* Can a component outside of a provider get its context? : 

***Easy. No need for Context. Provider . This is multiple contexts being used in one component, requiring just two calls to useContext versus wrapping your entire application in two nested contexts, which is what is what you have to do with current Context.***

* What are some common use cases for using the Context API? :

**Context is primarily used when some data needs to be accessible by many components at different nesting levels. Apply it sparingly because it makes component reuse more difficult. If you only want to avoid passing some props through many levels, component composition is often a simpler solution than context.**

* Describe “Context Hell” . 

What is the React Context hell? : 

**Like the callback hell, usual when jQuery was used for everything, the React Context hell is the nasty code you get taking advantage of the React Context API.**

## preparation materials : 

* What is ROLE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL (RBAC) ? : 

**Role-based access control (RBAC) restricts network access based on a person’s role within an organization and has become one of the main methods for advanced access control. The roles in RBAC refer to the levels of access that employees have to the network.**

* BENEFITS OF RBAC :

Reducing administrative work and IT support
Maximizing operational efficiency
Improving compliance
BEST PRACTICES FOR IMPLEMENTING RBAC :
Current Status:

Create a list of every software, hardware and app that has some sort of security. For most of these things, it will be a password. However, you may also want to list server rooms that are under lock and key. Physical security can be a vital part of data protection. Also, list the status of who has access to all of these programs and areas. This will give you a snapshot of your current data scenario.
Current Roles:

Even if you do not have a formal roster and list of roles, determining what each individual team member does may only take a little discussion. Try to organize the team in such a way that it doesn’t stifle creativity and the current culture (if enjoyed).
Write a Policy:

Any changes made need to be written for all current and future employees to see. Even with the use of a RBAC tool, a document clearly articulating your new system will help avoid potential issues.
Make Changes:

Once the current security status and roles are understood (not to mention a policy is written), it’s time to make the changes.
Continually Adapt:

It’s likely that the first iteration of RBAC will require some tweaking. Early on, you should evaluate your roles and security status frequently. Assess first, how well the creative/production process is working and secondly, how secure your process happens to be.
react-cookies component
To be able to access user cookies while doing server-rendering, you can use plugToRequest or setRawCookie.

How to Set a cookie value :
setCookie(name, value, [options])

name (string): cookie name
value (string	object): save the value and stringify the object if needed
options (object): Support all the cookie options from RFC 6265
path (string): cookie path, use / as the path if you want your cookie to be accessible on all pages
expires (Date): absolute expiration date for the cookie
maxAge (number): relative max age of the cookie from when the client receives it in seconds
domain (string): domain for the cookie (sub.domain.com or .allsubdomains.com)
secure (boolean): Is only accessible through HTTPS?
httpOnly (boolean): Can only the server access the cookie?
sameSite (boolean	none	lax	strict): Strict or Lax enforcement
How to Remove a cookie :
removeCookie(name, [options])

name (string): cookie name
options (object): Support all the cookie options from RFC 6265
path (string): cookie path, use / as the path if you want your cookie to be accessible on all pages
expires (Date): absolute expiration date for the cookie
maxAge (number): relative max age of the cookie from when the client receives it in seconds
domain (string): domain for the cookie (sub.domain.com or .allsubdomains.com)
secure (boolean): Is only accessible through HTTPS?
httpOnly (boolean): Can only the server access the cookie?
sameSite (boolean	none	lax	strict): Strict or Lax enforcement
How to Give access to your cookies anywhere :
withCookies(Component)

Add the following props to your component:

cookies: Cookies instance allowing you to get, set and remove cookies.
allCookies: All your current cookies in an object.
