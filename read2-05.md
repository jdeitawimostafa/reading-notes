# summarizing :

* in the source we can put the image adress or we can download it and drag and drop it into my folder of the project then add it by it's name and extension , in the alt : we can describe about the image will add , and we can use title attribute to add more information about the image . 

* we can change the width and height of it by using width and height and determine it's value in pixels . 

* we can insert the images through different places like : 
1. before a paragraph . 
2. inside a start of paragraph . 
3. in the middle of the paragraph . 

* we can align the image in the left or right bu using : align tag then left or right .

* there are three rules for creating images : 
- save images in the right format .

### chapter 11 (color) : 

* we can specify the color of text inside an element by using color property through 3 ways in css :
1. RGB values like : rgb(102,205,170) .
2. HEX codes like : #66cdaa .
3. color names like : MediumAquaMarine .

* also we can give a text background color because css treats the html elemnts as if it apeears in box by using background-color , and also we can add the color by using the three ways that i mentioned upove this point .
