* Q1 : What’s the difference between PUT and PATCH? 

* put method allows a complete editing of a document , http resources , patch reqeust is used to make changes to part of the resource , It is used to make minor updates to resources and it’s not required to be idempotent.

* Q3 : 

* Status and error codes refer to a code number in the response header that indicates the general classification of the response — for example, whether the request was successful (200), resulted in a server error (500), had authorization issues (403), and so on. Standard status codes don’t usually need much documentation, but custom status and error codes specific to your API do. Error codes in particular help in troubleshooting bad requests. 

Q4 : 

* SOAP and REST both allow you to create your own API. API stands for Application Programming Interface. It makes it possible to transfer data from an application to other applications. An API receives requests and sends back responses through internet protocols such as HTTP, SMTP, and others.

* SOAP is a standardized protocol that sends messages using other protocols such as HTTP and SMTP. The SOAP specifications are official web standards, maintained and developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). As opposed to SOAP, REST is not a protocol but an architectural style. The REST architecture lays down a set of guidelines you need to follow if you want to provide a RESTful web service, for example, stateless existence and the use of HTTP status codes.

* REST was created to address the problems of SOAP. Therefore it has a more flexible architecture. It consists of only loose guidelines and lets developers implement the recommendations in their own way. It allows different messaging formats, such as HTML, JSON, XML, and plain text, while SOAP only allows XML. REST is also a more lightweight architecture, so RESTful web services have a better performance. Because of that, it has become incredibly popular in the mobile era where even a few seconds matter a lot (both in page load time and revenue).

Vocabulary documintation : 
- Web Server : 
* hardware or software, or both of them working together. 1. On the hardware side, a web server is a computer that stores web server software and a website’s component files. (for example, HTML documents, images, CSS stylesheets, and JavaScript files) A web server connects to the Internet and supports physical data interchange with other devices connected to the web. 2. On the software side, a web server includes several parts that control how web users access hosted files. At a minimum, this is an HTTP server. An HTTP server is software that understands URLs (web addresses) and HTTP (the protocol your browser uses to view webpages). An HTTP server can be accessed through the domain names of the websites it stores, and it delivers the content of these hosted websites to the end user’s device.

- Express : 
* xpress.js is a free and open-source web application framework for Node.js. It is used for designing and building web applications quickly and easily. Web applications are web apps that you can run on a web browser. Since Express.js only requires javascript, it becomes easier for programmers and developers to build web applications and API without any effort.

- Routing : 
* Network routing is the process of selecting a path across one or more networks. The principles of routing can apply to any type of network, from telephone networks to public transportation. In packet-switching networks, such as the Internet, routing selects the paths for Internet Protocol (IP) packets to travel from their origin to their destination.


- WRRC : 
* The web is a cycle of requests and responses that flow between clients and servers.
