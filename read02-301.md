## what is jQuery ? 
* jQuery, Events, and The DOM : 
jQuery is a fast, lightweight, and feature-rich JavaScript library that is based on its motto “write less, do more”. jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, and animation much simpler.

* *All the power of jQuery is accessed via JavaScript, in order to use jQuery, the first thing you need to do is include the jQuery script in your page just like other scripts. You can download a copy of the jQuery library from www.jquery.com, or, as an alternative, you can include it from a CDN (Content Delivery Network), like Google or Microsoft*.

* What You Can Do with jQuery: There are lot more things you can do with jQuery : 

1. You can easily select elements to perform manipulation.
2. You can easily create effect like show or hide elements, sliding transition, and so on.
3. You can easily create complex CSS animation with fewer lines of code.
4. You can easily manipulate DOM elements and their attributes.
5. You can easily implement Ajax to enable asynchronous data exchange between client and server.
6. You can easily traverse all around the DOM tree to locate any element.

* SIMPLE SELECTORS As you saw in Chapter 5, which introduced the DOM, it is not always easy to select the elements that you want to. For example: • Older browsers do not support the latest methods for selecting elements. • IE does not treat whitespace between elements as text nodes, while other browsers do. Such issues make it hard to select the right elements on a page across all major browsers. Rather than learn a new way to select elements, jQuery uses a language that is already familiar to front-end web developers: CSS selectors. They: • Are much faster at selecting elements • Can be a lot more accurate about which elements to select • Often require a lot less code than older DOM methods • Are already used by most front-end developers jQuery even adds some extra CSS-style selectors which offer additional functionality. Since jQuery was created, modern browsers have implemented the querySe 1 ector () and querySe 1ectorA11 () methods to let developers select elements using CSS syntax. However, these methods are not supported in older browsers.

### programming work?
* How does pair programming work?
While there are many different styles, pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs. The Navigator might also utilize their computer as a second screen to look up solutions and documentation, but should not be writing any code.

* Why pair program? (Links to an external site.)
Pair programming touches on all four skills: developers explain out loud what the code should do, listen to others’ guidance, read code that others have written, and write code themselves.

- Greater efficiency
- Engaged collaboration
- Learning from fellow students
- Social skills
- Job interview readiness
- Work environment readiness
