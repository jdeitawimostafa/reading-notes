# summarizing : 

* Why choose Redux instead of the Context API for global state? :

- Context API prompts a re-render on each update of the state and re-renders all components regardless. Redux however, only re-renders the updated components. This can be monitored on the console as there’s a log in each component.

* What is the purpose of a reducer? :

- A reducer is a function that determines changes to an application’s state. It uses the action it receives to determine this change. We have tools, like Redux, that help manage an application’s state changes in a single store so that they behave consistently.

* What does an action contain? :

- Actions are the only source of information for the store as per Redux official documentation. It carries a payload of information from your application to store. const ITEMS_REQUEST = ‘ITEMS_REQUEST’; Apart from this type attribute, the structure of an action object is totally up to the developer.

* Why do we need to copy the state in a reducer? : 

- In the documentation of reducers(read it again for details!), redux only requires our reducers to stay pure. If the new state is different, the reducer must create new object, and making a copy is a way to describe the unchanged part.

* Terms : 

1. Immutable state: In object-oriented and functional programming, an immutable object (unchangeable object) is an object whose state cannot be modified after it is created. This is in contrast to a mutable object (changeable object), which can be modified after it is created.

2. Time travel in redux: The Redux DevTools records dispatched actions and the state of the Redux store at every point in time. … This makes it possible to inspect the state and travel back in time to a previous application state without reloading the page or restarting the app.

3. Action creator: An action creator is merely a function that returns an action object. Redux includes a utility function called bindActionCreators for binding one or more action creators to the store’s dispatch() function.

4. Reducer: In Redux, a reducer is a pure function that takes an action and the previous state of the application and returns the new state. The action describes what happened and it is the reducer’s job to return the new state based on that action.

5. Dispatch: dispatch is a function of the Redux store. You call store. dispatch to dispatch an action. This is the only way to trigger a state change. With React Redux, your components never access the store directly - connect does it for you.

**Using combineReducers** : 

* Core Concepts:

- The most common state shape for a Redux app is a plain Javascript object containing “slices” of domain-specific data at each top-level key. Similarly, the most common approach to writing reducer logic for that state shape is to have “slice reducer” functions, each with the same (state, action) signature, and each responsible for managing all updates to that specific slice of state. Multiple slice reducers can respond to the same action, independently update their own slice as needed, and the updated slices are combined into the new state object.

- Because this pattern is so common, Redux provides the combineReducers utility to implement that behavior. It is an example of a higher-order reducer, which takes an object full of slice reducer functions, and returns a new reducer function.

*  Defining State Shape : 

- There are two ways to define the initial shape and contents of your store’s state. First, the createStore function can take preloadedState as its second argument. This is primarily intended for initializing the store with state that was previously persisted elsewhere, such as the browser’s localStorage. The other way is for the root reducer to return the initial state value when the state argument is undefined. These two approaches are described in more detail in Initializing State, but there are some additional concerns to be aware of when using combineReducers.

- combineReducers takes an object full of slice reducer functions, and creates a function that outputs a corresponding state object with the same keys. This means that if no preloaded state is provided to createStore, the naming of the keys in the input slice reducer object will define the naming of the keys in the output state object. The correlation between these names is not always apparent, especially when using ES6 features such as default module exports and object literal shorthands.
