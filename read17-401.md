# summarizing : 

* Describe “The Cloud” : 
a server where ever the server place , as i user i can get data using cloud computing . 

* What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)? : 

 container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another .

 * What is auto-scaling ? :  

 Is a method used in cloud computing that dynamically adjusts the amount of computational resources in a server farm - typically measured by the number of active servers - automatically based on the load on the farm.

 * What is bandwidth? 

 it's the capacity that allows any system to transfer data using any connection . 

 * Terms : 

 1. Server Instances : A server instance is a collection of SQL Server databases which are run by a solitary SQL Server service or instance.

 2. containers : container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another .

 3. Cloud Services : a wide range of services delivered on demand to companies and customers over the internet, these services are designed to provide easy, affordable access to applications and resources without the need for internal infrastructure or hardware .

 4. Cloud Architecture :  the way technology components combine to build a cloud, in which resources are pooled through virtualization technology and shared across a network . 

 5. AWS : Amazon Web Services, a subsidiary of Amazon providing on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to individuals, companies, and governments on a metered pay-as-you-go basis .

 6. EC2/Beanstalk vs Heroku : EC2/Beanstalk is an Infrastructure as a Service product (IaaS), while Heroku is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) product .

 ## prepration materials : 

 * AWS S3 : 

**Cloud object storage service that offers scalability, data availability, security and performance , Capability to scale your storage resources up and down to meet fluctuating demands**. 

**Stores data across the S3 storage classes which support different data access levels at corresponding rates , Store your data in Amazon S3 and secure it from unauthorized access with encryption features and access management tools** .

**S3 is the only object storage service that allows you to block public access to all of your objects at the bucket or the account level S3 Access Points make it easy to manage data access with specific permissions for your applications using a shared data set** .

***Use cases: backup and restore, disaster recovery, archive, data lakes and big data analytics, hybrid cloud storage, cloud-native applications*** .



 * AWS Lambda Basics : 

**AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). Users of AWS Lambda create functions, self-contained applications written in one of the supported languages and runtimes, and upload them to AWS Lambda, which executes those functions in an efficient and flexible manner**.

**The Lambda functions can perform any kind of computing task, from serving web pages and processing streams of data to calling APIs and integrating with other AWS services**.

**The concept of “serverless” computing refers to not needing to maintain your own servers to run these functions. AWS Lambda is a fully managed service that takes care of all the infrastructure for you. And so “serverless” doesn’t mean that there are no servers involved: it just means that the servers, the operating systems, the network layer and the rest of the infrastructure have already been taken care of, so that you can focus on writing application code**.


* CDN (Links to an external site.) : 

**Content Distribution Network (CDN) is now available to new and existing customers with all our hosting packages. CDN provides your websites with a performance boost wherever your users are in the world. With increased loading times that benefits your website with dynamic caching; providing full control over the duration of caching of images, Javascript and CSS**.

***A CDN allows for the fast transfer of data needed for loading Internet content including HTML pages, JavaScript files, stylesheets, images, and videos . When a user requests a webpage that is part of a content delivery network, the CDN will redirect the request from the originating site’s server to a server in the CDN that is closest to the user and deliver the cached content*** .
