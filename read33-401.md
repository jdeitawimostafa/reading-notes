# summarizing : 

* Describe use cases for useMemo() and useReducer() :

**useReducer is used to store and update states, just like the useState Hook. It accepts a reducer function as its first parameter and the initial state as the second.**

**useMemo is a React hook that memorizes the output of a function. That is it. useMemo accepts two arguments: a function and a list of dependencies. useMemo will call the function and return its return value.**

* Why do custom hooks need the use prefix? : 

**Custom Hooks are JavaScript functions whose names are prefixed with the word use. A custom Hook is a normal function but we hold them to a different standard. By adding the word use to the beginning, it lets us know that this function follows the rules of Hooks.**

* What do custom hooks usually do? :

**Custom hooks allow us to have cleaner functional components, remove logic from the UI layer, and prevent code duplication by bringing common use cases to reusable hooks.**

- Using any list of custom hooks, research and name one that you think will be useful in your applications

- react-fetch-hook seems really powerful and will surely come in handy for my projects and applications.

* Terms : 

1. reducer: This is a function that determines the changes to an application’s state, using the action that it receives.

## preparation materials : 

* Context : 

**Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.**


* When to Use Context : 

**Context is designed to share data that can be considered “global” for a tree of React components, such as the current authenticated user, theme, or preferred language. For example, in the code below we manually thread through a “theme” prop in order to style the Button component.**



* Before You Use Context : 

**Context is primarily used when some data needs to be accessible by many components at different nesting levels. Apply it sparingly because it makes component reuse more difficult.**



* If you only want to avoid passing some props through many levels, component composition is often a simpler solution than context.

* Context.Consumer: A React component that subscribes to context changes. Using this component lets you subscribe to a context within a function component.

* Context.displayName: Context object accepts a displayName string property. React DevTools uses this string to determine what to display for the context.
