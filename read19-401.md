# summarizing : 

* Describe the similarities between AWS API Gateway + Lambda functions and an ExpressJS Server : 

**Express is commonly used for both web applications as well as REST APIs. While the primary API Gateway function is to deliver APIs, it can certainly be used for delivering web apps/sites (HTML) as well**.


* List the AWS Database offerings and talk about the pros and cons of each :
1. Amazon Relational Database Service 
2. Amazon Redshift .
3. Amazon DynamoDB .

* What’s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue? 

FIFO queues have essentially the same features as standard queues, but provide the added benefits of supporting ordering and exactly-once processing. FIFO queues provide additional features that help prevent unintentional duplicates from being sent by message producers or from being received by message consumers.

* How can the server be assured a message was properly received?
A Message Authentication Code (MAC) is a tag attached to a message to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the message. It is derived by applying a MAC algorithm to a message in combination with a secret key.

* Terms : 

1. serverless api : serverless is a cloud computing execution model where the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation and provisioning of servers.

2. triggers :  A trigger is a stored procedure in database which automatically invokes whenever a special event in the database occurs.

3. Dynamo vs Mongo : dynamo and mongo are a noSQL database ,  DynamoDB is a fully managed AWS service, MongoDB can be self installed or fully managed with MongoDB Atlas. ... DynamoDB uses tables, items and attributes, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents. DynamoDB supports limited data types and smaller item sizes; MongoDB supports more data types and has fewer size restrictions.

4. Dynamoose vs Mongoose : dynamoose is a modeling tool for amazon's database , where Mongoose provides a straight-forward, schema-based solution to model your application data. It includes built-in type casting, validation, query building, business logic hooks and more, out of the box.

prepration materials : 

* SQS is distributed queuing system. Messages are not pushed to receivers. Receivers have to poll SQS to receive messages. Messages can’t be received by multiple receivers at the same time. Any one receiver can receive a message, process and delete it. Other receivers do not receive the same message later. Polling inherently introduces some latency in message delivery in SQS unlike SNS where messages are immediately pushed to subscribers.


* Comparisons: SQS vs SNS in AWS — Simple Notification Service and Simple Queue Service :
