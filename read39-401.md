# summarizing : 

* What’s the best practice for “pre-loading” data into the store (onapplication start) in a Redux application? : 

- The most ‘redux-like’ way of handling the pre-loading of data would be to fire off the asynchronous action in the lifecycle method (probably componentWillMount) of a Higher Order Component that wraps your app. However, you will not use the results of the API call directly in that component - it needs to be handled with a reducer that puts it into your app store. This will require you to use some sort of a thunk middleware to handle the asynchronous action. Then you will use mapStateToProps to simply pass it down to the component that renders the data.

* When using a thunk/async action that dispatches the actual action, which do you export from your reducer? : 

- Redux Thunk is a middleware that lets you call action creators that return a function instead of an action object. That function receives the store’s dispatch method, which is then used to dispatch regular synchronous actions inside the function’s body once the asynchronous operations have been completed.

* Terms : 

1. middleware : functions that will execute between the process of the request and response . 

2. Thunk : Redux Thunk is middleware that allows you to return functions, rather than just actions, within Redux. This allows for delayed actions, including working with promises. One of the main use cases for this middleware is for handling actions that might not be synchronous, for example, using axios to send a GET request.

## preparation materials : 

* Redux Toolkit : 

The Redux Toolkit package is intended to be the standard way to write Redux logic. It was originally created to help address three common concerns about Redux:
“Configuring a Redux store is too complicated”
“I have to add a lot of packages to get Redux to do anything useful”
“Redux requires too much boilerplate code”
We can’t solve every use case, but in the spirit of create-react-app and apollo-boost, we can try to provide some tools that abstract over the setup process and handle the most common use cases, as well as include some useful utilities that will let the user simplify their application code.
Redux Toolkit also includes a powerful data fetching and caching capability that we’ve dubbed “RTK Query”. It’s included in the package as a separate set of entry points. It’s optional, but can eliminate the need to hand-write data fetching logic yourself.
These tools should be beneficial to all Redux users. Whether you’re a brand new Redux user setting up your first project, or an experienced user who wants to simplify an existing application, Redux Toolkit can help you make your Redux code better.


Using Redux Toolkit
The RTK Usage Guide docs page explains the standard usage patterns for each of RTK’s APIs. The API Reference section describes each API function and has additional usage examples.

The Redux Essentials tutorial also shows how to use each of the APIs while building an application.

* Migrating Vanilla Redux to Redux Toolkit
If you already know Redux and just want to know how to migrate an existing application to use Redux Toolkit, the “Modern Redux with Redux Toolkit” page in the Redux Fundamentals tutorial shows how RTK’s APIs simplify Redux usage patterns and how to handle that migration

Using Redux Toolkit with TypeScript
The RTK docs page on Usage with TypeScript shows the basic pattern for setting up Redux Toolkit with TypeScript and React, and documents specific TS patterns for each of the RTK APIs.

In addition, the Redux + TS template for Create-React-App comes with RTK already configured to use those TS patterns, and serves as a good example of how this should work .
