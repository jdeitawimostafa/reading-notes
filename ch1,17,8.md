### chapter 8 (extra markup) :
Since the web was first created, there have been several different versions of HTML such as :

- HTML4
- XHTML 1.0
- HTML5

**Because there have been several versions of HTML, each web page should begin with a DOCTYPE declaration to tell a browser which version of HTML 
the page is using**

*It is a good idea to add comments to your code because,no matter how familiar you are with the page at the time of writing it, when you come back to it later (or if someone else needs to look at the code),
comments will make it much easier to understand*.

***every HTML element can carry the id attribute.It is used to uniquely identify that element from other elements on the page. Its value should start with a letter or an underscore (not anumber or any other character). It is important that no two elements on the same page have the same value for their id attributes (otherwise the value is no longer unique),
also every html elemnt can caryy a class attribute*** 

- there are elments called block elments such as :
h1,p,li,ul , and there is elemnts called inline such as : a,b,em,img . 

- there is a grouping of text & inline elemnts such as : 
- span : when you want to differentiate text from it's surrounding text . 
- iframe : An iframe is like a little window that has been cut into your page â€” and in that window you
can see another page. 

*we can add an information to our page using meta , inside head such as* : 
- description , robots , kewwords , author , expires

**There are some characters that are used in
and reserved by HTML code** (escaped characters) :
less-than sign: & 1t;  , greater-than sign: & gt; copyright symbol : & copy; (without spaces after ampersand ,just to show you how to read it )

- header and footer 
- nav

*Older browsers that do not understand HTML5

block-level elements*.
