# summarizing : 
## chapter 3 (object literals) : 

* what is an object ? 
*An object is a collection of properties, and a property is an association between a name (or key) and a value. A property's value can be a function,
 in which case the property is known as a method* .

 ### chapter 5 (document object model) :
 
 * what is document object model (DOM) :
 The Document Object Model (DOM) specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML page and how JavaScript can access and update the contents of a web page while it is in the browser window. 

* this is the tree objects of DOM : 
![DOM](https://www.w3schools.com/js/pic_htmltree.gif)

* there is a method to find elements in the DOM tree called DOM queries ,
when you need to work with an element more than once , we can use a variable . 

* METHODS THAT RETURN A SINGLE ELEMENT NODE: 
1. By ld .
2. query selector (css selectors) . 

* there is a METHODS THAT RETURN ONE OR MORE ELEMENTS (AS A NODELIST): 
1. by className . 
3. by tagName . 
4. query selectorAll ( css selector) .

* DOM manipulation offers another technique to add new content to a page
 (rather than i nnerHTML). It involves three steps: 
 1. CREATE THE ELEMENT .
 2. GIVE IT CONTENT . 
 3. ADD IT TO THE DOM . 

 * also we can use DOM manipulation to remove elements from the DOM tree through these steps : 
 1. STORE THE ELEMENT TO BE REMOVED IN A VARIABLE .
 2. STORE THE PARENT OF THAT ELEMENT IN A VARIABLE . 
 3. REMOVE THE ELEMENT FROM ITS CONTA INING ELEMENT .
