# summarizing : 

* Does a deployed React application require a server? 

**No you don’t need a server , It also works well when integrated into an existing server side app**.

* Why do we prefer to test a React application at the behavior rather than the unit level?

**When it comes to React components you want to check how your component is rendered and if all props you pass to the component influence the behavior of your component as expected**.

* What does npm run build do?
**When you’re ready to deploy to production, running npm run build will create an optimized build of your app in the build folder**.

* Describe the actual composition / architecture of a React application ?

**React application is split into components, it is important that you can add functionality to a component without causing rippling changes through the codebase**.

* Terms : 
1. BDD: behavior driven development, a branch of Test Driven Development (TDD), which uses human-readable descriptions of software user requirements as the basis for software tests. 

2. Acceptance Tests: conducted to determine if the requirements of a specification or contract are met mounting.

3. Mounting: process by which the operating system makes files and directories on a storage device available for users to access via the computer’s file system.

4. build the process of converting source code into an “executable” bundle by the browser. 

## preparation materials : 

Understanding React setState
setState() is the only legitimate way to update state after the initial state setup. Let’s say we have a search component and want to display the search term a user submits.

            import React, { Component } from 'react'

                class Search extends Component {    
                constructor(props) {
                 super(props)

                    state = {
                 searchTerm: ''
                 }
            }
            }

We’re passing an empty string as a value and, to update the state of searchTerm, we have to call setState().

            setState({ searchTerm: event.target.value })




* Forms :

Forms Handling forms is about how you handle the data when it changes value or gets submitted. In HTML, form data is usually handled by the DOM. In React, form data is usually handled by the components. When the data is handled by the components, all the data is stored in the component state. You can control changes by adding event handlers in the onChange attribute


* Props : 

Props are read-only components. It is an object which stores the value of attributes of a tag and work similar to the HTML attributes. It allows passing data from one component to other components. It is similar to function arguments and can be passed to the component the same way as arguments passed in a function. Props are immutable so we cannot modify the props from inside the component.

* Testing Basically, React Testing Library (RTL) (Links to an external site.)
is made of simple and complete React DOM testing utilities that encourage good testing practices So rather than dealing with instances of rendered React components, your tests will work with actual DOM nodes. The utilities this library provides facilitate querying the DOM in the same way the user would. Finding form elements by their label text (just like a user would), finding links and buttons from their text (like a user would). It also exposes a recommended way to find elements by a data-testid as an “escape hatch” for elements where the text content and label do not make sense or is not practical.
