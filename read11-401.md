# summarizing : 

* Why is access control important ? 

because it's mitigate the risk of information being accessed without the appropriate authorisation, unlawfully and the risk of a data breach .

* Describe an application that would need access control ? 

we applied the lab 09 on the linkedin provider , and asked the server to get token access then asked the user to give a limited access to his/her information like (name,photos,info) by signing in . 

* What is a role used for ? 

the role used for to determine the rights than can the browser or the user brwosing and searching through thr directories that has an access to browsing it . 

* Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?

Discretionary Access Control provides a much more flexible environment than Mandatory Access Control but also increases the risk that data will be made accessible to users that should not necessarily be given access.

* Terms : 
1. Authorization: Authorization in system security is the process of giving the user permission to access a specific resource or function. This term is often used interchangeably with access control or client privilege.

2. Role Based Access Control : Role Based Access Control (RBAC), also known as Non discretionary Access Control, takes more of a real world approach to structuring access control. Access under RBAC is based on a user's job function within the organization to which the computer system belongs.

3. Capabilities : Capabilities are used to control access to system resources. In modern programming languages that execute code with different levels of trust in the same process, the propagation of such capabilities must be controlled so that they cannot unintentionally be obtained by unauthorised code.

## prepration materials : 


* Event-Driven Programming is a logical pattern that we can choose to confine our programming within to avoid issues of complexity and collision. 


* Event-Driven Programming makes use of the following concepts:

1. An Event Handler is a callback function that will be called when an event is triggered.
2. A Main Loop listens for event triggers and calls the associated event handler for that event.

* We access the EventEmitter class through the events module. Once imported we’ll need to create a new object from the class to start using it.



        const EventEmitter = require('events').EventEmitter;
        const myEventEmitter = new EventEmitter;

* Removing Listeners : 

- To remove event listeners in EventEmitter we can use the removeListener or removeAllListeners method. It’s important to note that in the EventEmitter that comes built-in with Node you must pass a reference to the exact function you wish to remove when using the removeListener method. This means wherever you wish to remove the event, you’ll need to make sure the function is able to be referenced from that place in your code. For this reason it is often best to name your event handling functions and declaring them before you register the event listener, as opposed to leaving them anonymous.
