# summarizing : 

Q1 : Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development ? 

1. Better program design and higher code quality .
2. Detailed project documentation .
3. Code flexibility and easier maintenance .

Q2 : In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?

*  to removes the explicit calls from the tests themselves, and invites inexperienced users to share state between tests.

Q3 : What is one downside of Test Driven Development ? 

1. You only write code that’s needed . 
2. More modular design . 
3. Easier to maintain .
4. Easier to refactor .

Q4 : What’s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes? 

* The most important difference between class- and prototype-based inheritance is that a class defines a type which can be instantiated at runtime, whereas a prototype is itself an object instance. 


Q5 : Why REST? 

1. REST is Easy to Understand and Implement .
2. REST Makes your Application More Scalable .
3. Caching is Easier with REST.
4. REST is Flexibile .

Terms : 
1. functional programming : 
* Functional Programming is a programming paradigm where you mostly construct and structure your code using functions. These functions take input which is called as arguments then shows the output based on the inputs being taken which, given the same input always results in the same output.

2. object-oriented programming (OOP) : 
* a style of Object-oriented programming (OOP) in which inheritance occurs via defining classes of objects, instead of inheritance occurring via the objects alone .

3. class : 
* Classes are a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data. Classes in JS are built on prototypes but also have some syntax and semantics that are not shared with ES5 class-like semantics. 

4. super :
* this is used to call the constructor of the super (parent) class .

5. this : 
* refers to the current object being instantiated .

6. REST : 
* Representational State Transfer. Uses HTTP requests to retrieve/use data.
