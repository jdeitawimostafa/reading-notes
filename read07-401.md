Bearer Authorization
Write the following steps in the correct order
Register your application to get a client_id and client_secret
Ask the client if they want to sign in via a third party
Redirect to a third party authentication endpoint
Make a request to the third-party API endpoint
Receive authorization code
Make a request to the access token endpoint
Receive access token
What can you do with an authorization code?
Authoriztion code can be used to set privilages to a user, or enter information or modify them.

What can you do with an access token?
Access tokens are used in token-based authentication to allow an application to access an API.

What’s a benefit of using OAuth instead of your own basic authentication?
Better security, token management provides you with a means of tracking each connected device that uses your API.also used to identify the users.

Vocabulary Terms
Client ID : Is used to identify the application. As per oAuth standard you need both Client ID & Client Secret along with user credentials to generate an access token.
Client Secret : secret known only to the application and the authorization server
Authentication Endpoint: The Authentication API enables you to manage all aspects of user identity when you use Auth0.
Access Token Endpoint: where apps make a request to get an access token for a user
API Endpoint : is a point at which an application program interface connects with the software program.
Authorization Code : temporary code that the client will exchange for an access token
Access Token : is an object encapsulating the security identity of a process or thread.

Preparation Materials
JWTs
A JSON Web Token (JWT) is a JSON object encoded as a long string. We use them to identify users. It’s similar to a passport or driver’s license. It includes a few public properties about a user in its payload. These properties cannot be tampered because doing so requires re-generating the digital signature.

When the user logs in, we generate a JWT on the server and return it to the client. We store this token on the client and send it to the server every time we need to call an API endpoint that is only accessible to authenticated users.

To generate JSON Web Tokens in an Express app use jsonwebtoken package.

Generating a JWT

const jwt = require(‘jsonwebtoken’);

const token = jwt.sign({ _id: user._id}, ‘privateKey’);

Never store private keys and other secrets in your codebase. Store them in environment variables. Use the config package to read application settings stored in environment variables.
