2. Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?

- Authentication, Authorization


3. What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?

- modularity

*** 
## prepration materials : 

* OAuth : 

* OAuth is “an open standard for access delegation” … In other words, OAuth serves as a way to give users the ability to grant application access to services, without giving the application their password.

* Through a series of “handshakes”, an application such as an Express Web Server asks the user if it’s ok to log in as them at some remote service, and then begins the process of authentication and access.


* How OAuth works?
* OAuth allows third-party services to exchange your information without you having to give away your password. Because the more you give away your password, the more you give away your passwords, the more likely it is that your passwords will get compromised.

* OAuth uses a system of tokens. Called “access tokens”. An access token gives one third-party source temporary access to a limited amount of your personal information on another third-party source.

* API Gateway OAuth Features Web-based client application registration. Generation of authorization codes, access tokens, and refresh tokens. Support for the following OAuth flows: Authorization Code. Implicit Grant. Resource Owner Password Credentials. Client Credentials. JWT. … Sample client applications for all supported flows.

* Advantages of OAuth 2.0 : 
1. is a very flexible protocol .

2. OAuth 2.0 relies on SSL which is used to ensure cryptography industry protocols and are being used to keep the data safe.

3. It allows limited access to the user's data and allows accessing when authorization tokens expire.

4. It has ability to share data for users without having to release personal information.

5. It is easier to implement and provides stronger authentication.
